# Fish Pond Water Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The **Fish Pond Water Monitoring System** is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and maintain the health of aquatic ecosystems. This project integrates multiple sensors to measure critical water parameters such as pH, temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), water level, and rain. The system provides real-time data visualization and enables efficient management of fish ponds.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Collects data on pH, temperature, TDS, water level, and rain.
- **IoT Integration:** Uses ESP32 and ESP8266 boards for seamless connectivity.
- **Data Display:** Real-time data is displayed on an LCD for local monitoring.
- **Cost-Effective:** Provides an affordable and scalable solution for fish pond management.

## Components Used
### Hardware
- ESP32 Board
- ESP8266 Board
- pH Sensor
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
- TDS Sensor
- Water Level Sensor
- Rain Sensor
- LCD Display

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C Programming
- Libraries:
  - `LiquidCrystal.h` for LCD
  - `DallasTemperature.h` for temperature sensor
  - `WiFi.h` for ESP32 connectivity
  - `PubSubClient.h` for MQTT communication

## System Architecture
1. **Sensors:** Collect data from the fish pond.
2. **Microcontrollers:** ESP32 processes the data, while ESP8266 handles connectivity.
3. **Data Visualization:** Real-time data is displayed on an LCD.
4. **Cloud Integration (Optional):** Can be integrated with cloud platforms for remote monitoring.
