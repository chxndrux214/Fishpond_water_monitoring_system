# Fish Pond Water Monitoring System

## Project Overview
The **Fish Pond Water Monitoring System** is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and maintain the health of aquatic ecosystems. This project integrates multiple sensors to measure critical water parameters such as pH, temperature, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), water level, and rain. The system provides real-time data visualization and enables efficient management of fish ponds.

## Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Collects data on pH, temperature, TDS, water level, and rain.
- **IoT Integration:** Uses ESP8266 board for seamless connectivity.
- **Data Display:** Real-time data is displayed on an LCD for local monitoring.
- **Cloud Integration:** Utilizes ThingSpeak for remote data visualization.
- **Cost-Effective:** Provides an affordable and scalable solution for fish pond management.

## Components Used
### Hardware
- ESP8266 Board
- pH Sensor
- Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20)
- TDS Sensor
- Water Level Sensor
- Rain Sensor
- LCD Display

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C Programming
- Libraries:
  - `LiquidCrystal.h` for LCD
  - `DallasTemperature.h` for temperature sensor
  - `WiFi.h` for ESP8266 connectivity
  - `ThingSpeak.h` for cloud communication

## System Architecture
1. **Sensors:** Collect data from the fish pond.
2. **Microcontroller:** ESP8266 processes the data and uploads it to ThingSpeak.
3. **Data Visualization:** Real-time data is displayed on an LCD and ThingSpeak dashboard.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Install Arduino IDE.
- Set up the necessary libraries in the Arduino IDE.
- Create a ThingSpeak account and set up a new channel.
- Assemble the hardware as per the circuit diagram.

### Steps

1. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
2. Update the code with your WiFi credentials and ThingSpeak API keys.
3. Upload the code to the ESP8266 board.
4. Connect the sensors and LCD as per the circuit diagram.
5. Power the system and observe real-time data on the LCD and ThingSpeak dashboard.


### Circuit Details
- **pH Sensor:** Connects to analog input pin.
- **Temperature Sensor (DS18B20):** Connects to digital pin with a pull-up resistor.
- **TDS Sensor:** Connects to analog input pin.
- **Water Level Sensor:** Connects to digital pin.
- **Rain Sensor:** Connects to digital pin.
- **LCD Display:** Connected via I2C for efficient data display.

## Applications
